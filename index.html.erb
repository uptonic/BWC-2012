  <p><strong>We sweat the details so you don't have to.</strong> Remodeling can be stressful. We take care of every single detail so you can relax and enjoy the process. We are your one point of contact from beginning to end.</p>
  <p><strong>We're fun to have around.</strong> We love what we do and hope our clients will enjoy the process as well. This is our passion, not just a job. Our clients are often sad to see go when the project is complete.</p>
</div>

<div class="grid_4">
  <p><strong>We do it right the first time.</strong> Our daily on-site supervision of your project from start to finish ensures that the workmanship meets our own strict quality standards. We don’t cut corners.</p>
  <p><strong>We're predictable.</strong> You don’t like surprises in remodeling, neither do we. Our extensive work before your project even starts on specifications and details minimizes the likelihood of unpleasant surprises. We provide a fixed cost for a fixed project scope before the first hammer flies.</p>
