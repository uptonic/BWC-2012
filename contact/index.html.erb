    &quot;It has been such a pleasure working with you all-again. This could have been a very stressful project, but I was confident, right from the start, that it would turn out fine.  I just let you do all of the stressing! It has really been refreshing working with someone with such high standards, especially after what we went through with our home builder, Mr. Excuses.&quot; <cite>&ndash; N. Callahan (lower level remodel)</cite>
