    <h3>Construction</h3>
    <h4>With your Lead Carpenter</h4>
    <p>You will have a Lead Carpenter on site daily from project start to finish, constructing as well as managing the details of your project. Many builders stop by once a day to check on subcontractors who are doing their work. BW is hands-on, there all day, every day to supervise so you donâ€™t have to. Your Lead Carpenter is your daily point of contact to ensure regular communication throughout the process. Your project is their only priority.</p>
