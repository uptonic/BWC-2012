  <h3>BW Goes Above and Beyond</h3>
  <blockquote style="margin:0;">
    &quot;We want to throw roses at your lead carpenter's feet. He is bright, competent, conscientious, and considerate. Not a day went by when he didn't go far beyond to be sure we had what we needed. He cleaned up the site meticulously every day and was particularly careful (and friendly) with the cats. We all appreciate his work ethic and his suggestions.&quot;

  <h3>Use Again &amp; Again</h3>
  <blockquote style="margin:0;">
    &quot;In the end, the best testimony we can give is that we continue to absolutely love our home. We receive constant comments about the quality of craftsmanship and we give the nod to you and your team. There are not many people we have met that say they would choose the same contractor all over again. We would and we have.&quot;

  <h3>High Standards</h3>
  <blockquote style="margin:0 0 2em 0;font-size:0.9em;">
    &quot;It has been such a pleasure working with you all-again. This could have been a very stressful project, but I was confident, right from the start, that it would turn out fine. I just let you do all of the stressing! It has really been refreshing working with someone with such high standards, especially after what we went through with our home builder, Mr. Excuses.&quot;

  <h3>Fixed Budgets, No Surprises</h3>
  <blockquote style="margin:0;font-size:0.9em;">
    &quot;It was clear that BW was working in the real world where time and budgets are important. At no time did they ever cut corners to make up for an unexpected overage on their side.&quot;

    &quot;Thanks again for another wonderful building experience! I canâ€™t think of anyone else I would turn my house/life over to and leave the state. For the whole summer. Again.&quot;

  <h3>Experts in Their Field</h3>
  <blockquote style="margin:0 0 2em 0;font-size:0.9em;">
    &quot;The initial phase was very complicated with many decisions between architect, builder, and owner. Randy worked with us very patiently going over countless pros and cons of various approaches. We had no experience or expertise in these matters, so his explanations were of tremendous help. This was a once-in-a-lifetime experience for us and we came away with a fabulous finished product.&quot;
