  <h3>BW Goes Above and Beyond</h3>
  <blockquote style="margin:0;">
    &quot;We want to throw roses at your lead carpenter's feet. He is bright, competent, conscientious, and considerate. Not a day went by when he didn't go far beyond to be sure we had what we needed. He cleaned up the site meticulously every day and was particularly careful (and friendly) with the cats. We all appreciate his work ethic and his suggestions.&quot;

  <h3>Use Again &amp; Again</h3>
  <blockquote style="margin:0;">
    &quot;In the end, the best testimony we can give is that we continue to absolutely love our home. We receive constant comments about the quality of craftsmanship and we give the nod to you and your team. There are not many people we have met that say they would choose the same contractor all over again. We would and we have.&quot;
